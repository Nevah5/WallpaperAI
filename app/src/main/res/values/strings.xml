    <string name="help_question1">What is an API Key?</string>
    <string name="help_question1_answer">An API Key tells the AI who you are and that you are allowed to use it. Because this app uses OpenAI, you have to "login" into OpenAI. This is done via the API Key.</string>
    <string name="help_question2">Can I generate Images without an API Key?</string>
    <string name="help_question2_answer">No, sadly you can\'t. You have to provide an API Key for the AI to be able to generate images.</string>
    <string name="help_question3">I created a Widget, how can I use it?</string>
    <string name="help_question3_answer">Go to your home screen, edit it and then you should find a button somewhere to add Widgets. The generated Widget from WallpaperAI should be shown there.</string>
